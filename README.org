#+TITLE: Lotto

Inspired by Mr. Matthew Sinclair.

* Getting the statistics
The frequencies of numbers coming up can be found on the [[https://www.national-lottery.com/lotto/statistics][National Lottery
website]]. There we find a grid of red numbered balls with associated drawn
counts.

* What's in the box?
In ~dev/lotto/fetch.clj~ you'll find code that fetches the National Lottery page
of stats and extracts the stats we're interested in via the fantastic Enlive
(which wraps TagSoup). This code generates data that we spit into an EDN file
for later processing.

~src/lotto/analyze.clj~ is where the processing happens. For our purposes we're
not doing any heavy lifting because we're only really interested in how Clojure
enables us to trivially manipulate data.
